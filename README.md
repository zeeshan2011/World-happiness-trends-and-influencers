## **Data Description**  
The dataset used is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness), containing the following columns:  
- **Country**: Name of the country.  
- **Happiness Rank**: Overall rank based on happiness score.  
- **Happiness Score**: A composite score based on various factors.  
- **Economy (GDP per Capita)**: Economic productivity of a country.  
- **Family**: Social support.  
- **Health (Life Expectancy)**: Life expectancy at birth.  
- **Freedom**: Freedom to make life choices.  
- **Trust (Government Corruption)**: Public perception of corruption.  
- **Generosity**: Willingness to help others.  
- **Year**: Year of the data collection.

## **Methodology**  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examined trends, distributions, and relationships between variables.  
2. **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards and visualizations using Tableau.  
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Performed regression and clustering to identify key factors and group similar countries.  
4. **Regional Categorization**: Added regions to analyze disparities across geographical areas.

## **Key Findings**  
- **Economic Factors**: Higher GDP per capita correlates strongly with happiness.  
- **Health and Social Support**: Life expectancy and family support are critical drivers of happiness.  
- **Freedom and Trust**: Countries with greater freedom and less corruption tend to be happier.  
- **Regional Disparities**: Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have lower happiness scores compared to Europe and North America.

## **Visualizations**  
Key visualizations created include:  
- **Line Chart**: Global happiness trends (2015–2019).  
- **Choropleth Maps**: Year-wise happiness scores by country.  
- **Scatterplots**: Relationships between happiness and factors like GDP, health, and freedom.  
- **Boxplots**: Happiness scores by region.  
- **Bar Charts**: Top predictors of happiness.

## **Limitations**  
- **Data Coverage**: The dataset spans only from 2015 to 2019, limiting long-term trend analysis.  
- **Simplified Metrics**: Happiness is subjective and influenced by cultural factors not fully captured in the dataset.  
- **Outliers**: Certain countries deviate significantly from expected trends, requiring further investigation.

## **Future Work**  
- Expand the analysis with updated datasets for years beyond 2019.  
- Explore additional factors, such as education and environmental sustainability, that may impact happiness.  
- Incorporate machine learning models to predict happiness scores for future years.  
- Conduct deeper analyses into specific regions with low happiness scores to propose tailored interventions.
